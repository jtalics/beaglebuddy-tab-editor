1. Other instrument is assumed to be a treble instrument, like a guitar, with 6 or 7 strings.
   This really needs to be split into two instruments: Other (treble) and Other (bass).
2. The ptb converter
   a. needs to add the new Other (bass) instrument in its convertGuitars() method.
   b. needs to try and determine what kind of staff is used (analagous to the way it tries to determine what kind of instrument is used in convertGuitars()).
   c. name all tunings not found in the tuning dictionary "custom"
3. need to refactor InstrumentIn
   a. should only have one data member indicating which staff the instrument comes in on - not two like it does now (one for rhythm staff and one for regular staffs)
   b. should not be an array of booleans, but rather an ArrayList<Byte> instrumentIds;
   c. once this is done, propogate the change to the conversion and the ActiveInstruments class.
4. investigate RhythmStaff.
   a. can this be made into a derived class of Staff like all the other staffs, or does it need to remain its own unique type
