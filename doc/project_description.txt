There is an existing free music notation editor called power tab, version 1.7, which is available
for download at http://www.power-tab.net/guitar.php.  It was released 7 years ago, and the author
has promised a version 2.0 ever since.  However, after 7 years of waiting, he has never released
a new version.  The current version has some bugs, as well as some limitations.  Even with these
shortcomings, the power tab editor has gained wide popularity for two main reasons:
1. the editor is free
2. people can submit\download transcribed songs to many hosting sites (analogous to mp3 sharing sites)

This project is an attempt at being the successor to the power tab editor.
It will fix the bugs in the existing release of power tab editor, and will remove the limitations
that currently exist in the power tab editor.  The new music notation editor, called the beaglebuddy
tab editor, will have the following features:

1. written entirely in java
   a. it will thus be able to run on any platform for which there is a jvm, as opposed to power tab,
      which is written in Microsoft Visual C++ and MFC, and hence restricted to Windows machines.
2. internationalized
   a. support is currently built in for english, german, and spanish via resource bundles.
   b. on-line help stored in html files is also internationalized.
3. backwards compatible with the existing power tab editor
   a. the author of the power tab editor has released the file format for power tab files.
      code to read in existing power tab files (.ptb) and to convert them to the new beaglebuddy
      format have already been written.
   b. standalone converter which can be used by existing power tab file sharing sites to convert
      their files to the new beaglebuddy format has been written.
4. support for more instruments
   a. the power tab editor is limited to 3 staffs and splits the music into two separate scores:
      a "guitar" and a "bass" score.
   b. the power tab editor does not support drums
   c. the power tab editor has some notable bugs
      1. can only copy and paste once.
      2. not able to anchor text within a staff.
      3. no support for staffs for vocals.
   d. the beaglebuddy tab editor will rectify these short comings
5. development of the beaglebuddy editor will use industry standard tools
   a. ant            - for builds
   b. eclipse        - ide for writing\refactoring code
   c. java 1.6       - latest jdk
   d. subversion     - for source code repository
   e. google project - for hosting of project site



There are currently two developers working on this project.
Due to the amount of work that remains, it has been determined that two more programmers are needed in
order to finish the application in a 6 month time frame.
